## Interoperability

Bosonic provides you with a custom polyfills build, which use some Polymer polyfills mixed with our own ShadowDOM polyfill. But, as Bosonic transpiles your elements to vanilla JS Custom Elements, they are fully interoperable with Polymer and x-tags elements.

In short, you can use Bosonic elements with the [Polymer platform](http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/platform.html)!
