# Contribute

## Source code
Fork it on [Github](https://github.com/bosonic).

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality/element. Lint and test your code using Grunt.

## Discussion
For now, we've got only two ways to stay in touch: [Github](https://github.com/bosonic) and our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/bosonic_project).

We'll soon open a Google group and an IRC channel.

## What do you need ?

- More elements: the more the better...
- Better documentation: if you're fluent, you can help!
- Tasks for alternative task runners: we currently only have a grunt one, if you use Gulp/Pint/Make/Whatever, you're welcome to build us a transpilation task!
